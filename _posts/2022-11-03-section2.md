In this section, we study extensive games, which are games in which players make their moves in sequence. 

We start with some motivating examples of games with sequential moves; the familiar game tick-tack-toe and a second game, removing coins. We first will try to get a sense for the types of strategic interactions we are interested in and to motivate the definition of extensive games. I then provide a (relatively) formal definition of extensive games, and discuss the notion of strategies and outcomes in extensive games, which are more complicated objects than in simple strategic games. 

After that, we  discuss Nash equilibria of extensive games. The basic notion of Nash equilibrium is the same as before: no player has a profitable deviation! But since strategies are a bit more complicated, it takes a little bit more effort to understand what Nash equilibria in extensive games are, and how to find them. 

Finally, we consider the problem of empty threats and empty promises. The Nash equilibrium has the problem that it allows outcomes that are sustained by making threats that the person making the threat would never want to carry out (think of parents making empty threats to their children). We'll discuss what  this means in terms of our games, and discuss an equilibrium refinement called the subgame perfect equilibrium that removes equilibria that entail such empty threats. We'll also talk about how to find subgame perfect equilibria in finite game through the process of backwards induction.
