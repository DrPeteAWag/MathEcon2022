### Lecture Videos

This week we are going to the continue talking about strategic games and Nash equilibria. Our focus will be on "best responses" a concept that is needed to solve more complicated games with many players and actions. 

In the first video, I give you a motivating example, the formal definition of best responses and then some illustrations.

The second video expands on this a little, and gives two further examples, each with a continuum of actions:

In the last video, I talk about the notion of domination, and give an example of an equilibrium in weakly dominated strategies in a voting game.
