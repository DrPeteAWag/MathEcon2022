### Lecture Videos
This week, we will be focusing our attention on a review of some basic concepts from probability theory and statistics. To view the videos in full screen, open them in a new tab. 

1. In my [first video], I review the notions of probability distributions, discrete and continuous random variables, and expectation.

1. In my [second video], I revisit the notion of conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule and  independence.

1. In the [third video], I then explain how we use these concepts to incorporate random draws into decision problems, which we will later extend to game theoretic settings.

### Additional Resources: 
1. If you feel like you would like to have a more basic review of these concepts, take a look at the lesson in [Khan academy here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables). You might also find the **exercises** there helpful. 
1. The [wikipedia article on probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) might also be helpful.
